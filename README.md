# AI Helper: Your Collaborative Coding Assistant

AI Helper bridges the gap between your codebase and advanced AI models, creating a seamless workflow for code analysis and improvement. At its core, the tool lets developers selectively share portions of their project with AI models, controlling exactly what code files and contextual documentation are included in each conversation. Rather than copying and pasting snippets into chat interfaces, AI Helper allows you to curate the perfect prompt, combining your questions with relevant code selections, and receive targeted insights directly within your development environment. The flexible block-based message construction gives you complete control over how you frame your questions, helping you get precisely the type of analysis, explanations, or suggestions you need.

Designed for real-world development scenarios, AI Helper excels at tasks ranging from architectural reviews and refactoring suggestions to documentation generation and bug identification. The tool recognizes that different coding questions require different contexts â€“ sometimes you need to share implementation details across multiple files, while other times you only need feedback on a specific algorithm. By maintaining a library of custom prompts and supporting both Claude and GPT models, AI Helper adapts to your preferred working style and the specific challenges of your project. Whether you're trying to understand legacy code, improve performance bottlenecks, or ensure security best practices, AI Helper creates the optimal communication channel between your codebase and AI assistance.
